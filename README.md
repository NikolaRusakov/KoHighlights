**KoHighlights** is a utility for viewing and converting the [Koreader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader)'s history files to simple text.  
This is a totally re-written application using the Qt framework (PySide).  
The original KoHighlights (using the wxPython) can be found [here](https://github.com/noonkey/KoHighlights).
